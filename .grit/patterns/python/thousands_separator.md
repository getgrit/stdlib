title: Add thousands separator
---

Add thousands separator (`1_000_000`) to numbers (ints and floats, positive or negative).

```grit
engine marzano(0.1)
language python

or {
	integer(),
	float()
} as $number where {
	or {
		and {
			$number <: r"(-?\d+)(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{3})((?:\.\d+)?)$"($head, $g1, $g2, $g3, $g4, $fractional),
			$groups = [$head, $g1, $g2, $g3, $g4]
		},
		and {
			$number <: r"(-?\d+)(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{3})((?:\.\d+)?)$"($head, $g1, $g2, $g3, $fractional),
			$groups = [$head, $g1, $g2, $g3]
		},
		and {
			$number <: r"(-?\d+)(\d{3})(\d{3})((?:\.\d+)?)$"($head, $g1, $g2, $fractional),
			$groups = [$head, $g1, $g2]
		},
		and {
			$number <: r"(-?\d+)(\d{3})((?:\.\d+)?)$"($head, $group, $fractional),
			$groups = [$head, $group]
		}
	},
	$formatted = join(list=$groups, separator="_"),
	$formatted = join(list=[$formatted, $fractional], separator="")
} => `$formatted`
```

## Add thousands separator to number

```python
for n in range(1000):
    pass

n = -1000 - 2000
n = 1000000000
n = 123456789123456

x = 1000.123
x = 1000000000.123
x = -123456789123456.123

m = 1000000000000000

# Left as is

n = 999
x = 999.0
```

```python
for n in range(1_000):
    pass

n = -1_000 - 2_000
n = 1_000_000_000
n = 123_456_789_123_456

x = 1_000.123
x = 1_000_000_000.123
x = -123_456_789_123_456.123

m = 1000_000_000_000_000

# Left as is

n = 999
x = 999.0
```
