title: Replace `csv` â‡’ `defusedcsv`
tags: [fix, security]
---

If you're generating a CSV file using the built-in `csv` module and incorporating user data, there's a potential security risk. An attacker might inject a formula into the CSV file, which, when imported into a spreadsheet application, could execute a malicious script, leading to data theft or even malware installation on the user's computer. To enhance security, consider using `defusedcsv` as a direct substitute for `csv`. `defusedcsv` maintains the same API but aims to thwart formula injection attempts, providing a safer way to create CSV files.
