title: Use secure hashes
tags: [security, hash]

The hashing functions `md2`, `md4`, `md5`, and `sha1` are detected as cryptographically insecure due to known vulnerabilities. It is advisable to use more secure hashing algorithms for cryptographic purposes.

```grit
language rust

or { `Md2::new()`, `Md4::new()`, `Md5::new()`, `Sha1::new()`} => `Sha256::new()`
```

## With Md2

```rust
let mut hasher = Md2::new();
```

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```

## With Md4

```rust
let mut hasher = Md4::new();
```

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```

## With Md5

```rust
let mut hasher = Md5::new();
```

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```

## With sha1

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha1::new();
```

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```

## With sha256

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```
